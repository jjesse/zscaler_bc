# Overview of Scripts

These are a set of scripts to help build Branch Connector from Zscaler (<https://help.zscaler.com/cloud-branch-connector/what-zscaler-branch-connector>) in a lab. These are not supported by Zscaler at all and for personal use.

There are two folders included in this repository:

- ISO_Generator: Scripts to download and generate the ISO for Branch Connector
